intro: "When you're creating your own WordPress theme or adapting an existing theme, pay attention to your code structure and semantics. This will benefit your website greatly: it improves your SEO because search engines know better what to expect on your site. It will also improve your site's accessibility: meaning that people who use assistive technologies, can better use your website."
